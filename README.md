## An app for kids who can't program good and want to learn how to do other stuff good too.

I wasn't like every other kid, you know, who dreams about being an astronaut, I was always more interested in what bark was made out of on a tree.  Eventually I learned about files and how they're IN the computer, and I decided to make this app.  To be fair, it should be...at least...3 times larger than it is, but that's a work in progress.
